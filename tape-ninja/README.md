## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/suitcase-saver-pro.git
cd suitcase-saver-pro

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Build for Production
```bash

npm run build

# Preview the build
npm run preview
```

## üìä How It Works

### Core Calculation Formula
```
tapeLength = base * quantity * (1 + anxietyFactor/10) * (1 + brutalityIndex/8)
```

Where:
- **base**: Container-specific multiplier (0.6m - 2.2m)
- **quantity**: Number of containers (currently 1 per calculation)
- **anxietyFactor**: User's security level (0-10)
- **brutalityIndex**: Airline's baggage handling rating (0-10)

### Container Multipliers
| Container Type | Multiplier | Description |
|----------------|------------|-------------|
| Plastic Bag | 2.2m | High risk, needs lots of tape |
| Glass Jar | 1.8m | Fragile, careful packing required |
| Coffee Bottle | 1.5m | Moderate risk |
| Plastic Bottle | 1.2m | Standard protection |
| Banana Leaf | 1.0m | Traditional, moderate risk |
| Cardboard Box | 0.9m | Sturdy but needs sealing |
| Tupperware | 0.8m | Reliable, minimal tape |
| Steel Dabba | 0.7m | Indestructible, minimal tape |
| Plastic Pouch | 0.6m | Lightweight, easy to secure |

### Airline Brutality Indices
| Airline | Brutality Index | Description |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| Budget Airline | 10 | "Baggage handler's revenge" |
| SpiceJet | 9 | High turbulence expected |
| IndiGo | 8 | Moderate brutality |
| Air India | 7 | Standard handling |
| British Airways | 5 | Professional but busy |
| Vistara | 4 | Gentle handling |
| Emirates | 3 | Premium service |
| Qatar Airways | 2 | Careful handling |
| Singapore Airlines | 2 | Excellent service |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Key Components
- **Calculator.tsx**: Main application logic and calculation engine
- **DragDropContainerSelector.tsx**: Container selection interface
- **AnimatedSuitcase.tsx**: Visual feedback component
- **BananaChipParticles.tsx**: Decorative background animation

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface Container {
  type: string;
  risk: "Low" | "Medium" | "High" | "Very High";
  packing: string;
  tape: string;
  foods: string[];
  image: string;
  description: string;
}

interface ContainerWithFood extends Container {
  selectedFood?: string;
}

interface CalculationResults {
  tapeLength: { cm: number; mm: number; uncleArmSpans: number };
  tapeType: string;
  bubbleWrapLayers: number;
  leakProbability: number;
  packingInstructions: string;
  roastMessage: string;
  riskLevel: string;
  achievements: string[];
}
```

## üéØ Customization

### Adding New Containers
Edit `src/data/containers.ts`:
```typescript
export const containers: Container[] = [
  {
    type: "Your Container",
    risk: "Medium",
    packing: "Your packing instructions",
    tape: "Recommended tape type",
    foods: ["Food1", "Food2"],
    image: "https://your-image-url.com/image.jpg",
    description: "Humorous description"
  }
];
```

### Adding New Foods
Add to the `allFoods` array in `src/data/containers.ts`:
```typescript
export const allFoods = [
  // ... existing foods
  "Your New Food"
];
```

### Adding Sarcastic Messages
Add to the `sarcasticMessages` object:
```typescript
export const sarcasticMessages: Record<string, Record<string, string>> = {
  "Container Type": {
    "Food Item": "Your sarcastic message here"
  }
};
```

### Modifying Calculation Formula
Edit the calculation logic in `src/utils/calculator.ts`:
```typescript
// Modify the core formula in calculatePacking function
let tapeLength = base * quantity * (1 + anxietyFactor / 10) * (1 + brutalityIndex / 8);
```
